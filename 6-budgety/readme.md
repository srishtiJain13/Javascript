we will learn:-
To use Module pattern,
private n public data, encapsulation.
The answer is that we create modules because
we want to keep pieces of code that are
related to one another together
inside of separate, independent, and organized units.
And in each of these modules, we'll have variables
and functions that are private, which means that
they are only accessible inside of the module.
We want it so that no other code can override our data.
So our data or code is going to be safe
and this is really important.
And beside private variables and methods, we're
also gonna have public methods, which means that
we expose them to the public so that other functions
or modules can access and use them.
And this is called data encapsulation.

So data encapsulation allows us to hide the
implementation details of a specific module
from the outside scope so that we only expose
a public interface which is sometimes called an API.
